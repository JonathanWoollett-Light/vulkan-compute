# Hello World!

While quite a bit more complex than what one might consider a hello world, this project serves the same purpose, it is our introductory project.

GPU programming in general especially compute is quite a bit more complex than typical programming (arguably unnecessarily).

The project is to use our device to fill an array with the values of its indices:

`[0,0,0,...]` â†’ `[0,1,2,...]`

I expect you may reference the appropriate sections in [the completed project](https://github.com/JonathanWoollett-Light/vulkan-012) as you read through this book.

It is by the nature of this section that we must lightly traverse many elements of Vulkan to get a basic example running; allow yourself a light understanding.

I will cover topics in growing depth as we naturally require as our desired functionality becomes more complex in future projects.

For this project I use the [Getting started](ch02-00-getting-started.md) project as the starting boilerplate.
